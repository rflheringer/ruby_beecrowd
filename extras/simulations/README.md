# Simulations – Beecrowd Extras

This folder contains **experimental and educational scripts** created while
studying problems from the Beecrowd platform.

⚠️ **Important:**  
The files in this folder are **NOT official Beecrowd solutions** and should not
be submitted to the judge.

They were created to:
- Better understand problem dynamics
- Test logic through simulations
- Practice Ruby syntax and control structures

## Vampire Battle – Problem 1093

**File:** `vampire_battle_1093.rb`

This script simulates the battle described in Beecrowd problem **1093**.

### Purpose
- Understand how the probability model works
- Visualize combat rounds step by step
- Experiment with randomness (`rand`) and loops

### What this script does
- Simulates dice rolls
- Applies damage and regeneration
- Stops when one vampire reaches zero life
- Prints battle events to the terminal

### Why this exists
The official problem requires a mathematical solution.
This simulation was written **only to understand the mechanics of the fight**.

## Notes
- Output verbosity is intentional
- Random behavior makes each execution different
