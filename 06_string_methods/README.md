# 05 - Strings and Text Manipulation

This folder contains exercises focused on **String handling in Ruby** and common text manipulation techniques.

The main goal is to practice operations frequently used in Beecrowd problems and in real-world Ruby development, such as input parsing, output formatting, and string processing.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Type conversion (`to_s`, `to_i`, `to_f`)
- Reading multiple values from a single line (`gets.split`)
- String manipulation
  - Removing characters
  - Replacing substrings
  - Concatenation
- Output formatting
  - `format`
  - string interpolation (`#{}`)
- Common Ruby string methods:
  - `chomp`
  - `split`
  - `delete`
  - `sub` / `gsub`

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to improve familiarity with Ruby's native string methods and to write clearer, more idiomatic Ruby code.

The solutions are not focused only on passing test cases, but also on readability and learning good practices.

## 🧪 Notes

Some files may contain alternative implementations or exploratory code created for learning and experimentation purposes.
