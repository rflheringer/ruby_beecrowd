# Basic I/O and Math

This folder contains introductory Ruby exercises focused on:

- Standard input and output
- Numeric conversions (`to_i`, `to_f`)
- Arithmetic operations
- Floating-point precision
- Output formatting with `printf` / `format`

These problems helped me build a solid foundation in Ruby syntax
and problem-solving using simple mathematical logic.
